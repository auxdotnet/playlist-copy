# Playlist-Copy

Java Application to copy all files which are listed in a playlist (or other kind of) file.

The current work on the project deals with an improvement of the Code-Architecture, because the original code was written a few years ago. 

TODO:
* Right now the GUI components want to be separated from the controller compoenents (maybe MVP)
