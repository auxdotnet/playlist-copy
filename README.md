# Playlist-Copy

A Java Application to copy all files which are listed in a playlist (or other kind of) file.

The major focus on this project lies on the separation between the GUI and the Data Classes. 
Even though the complexity of this project is clear, a clean Code-Architecture is sought.
New GUI types can be added without big adjustments of the architecture.
